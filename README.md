# DateNightApp
# Overview

Our Date Night app helps people find activities for their date nights. After registering/loging in, a user can swipe through activities stored in our Firestore database. When they find an activity they like, they can swipe right on it to save it. After saving activities, a user can view their saved activities or view any activity matches between them and another user (their date). A user can also clear their saved activities if they would like to.

Our purpose in creating Date Night is to help cure the common struggle of date picking indecisiveness. Many couples don't know what they want to do, they don't know what is around them, or they can't agree on an activity. Our app will help couples simplify their date night planning.
